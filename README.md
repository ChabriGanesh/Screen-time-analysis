# 🎬 Screen-time-analysis

Indian Kids' Daily Screen Time analysis through various platform usage and their localities.  
Their screen time was analyzed along with associated health impacts. 📱🧒👧

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: **`indian-kids-screentime-2025`**.  
It contains detailed data on screen time by age, gender, locality, devices, and health effects.

---

## 💻 JupyterLab Analysis

The analysis is performed in **JupyterLab** using **Python** and key libraries including **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 🔍 Process of Analysis

1. **Download Dataset:**  
   Download the dataset locally to ensure fast, offline access.
   
2. **Set Up Environment:**  
   Specify the directory for the dataset.

3. **Create Notebook:**  
   Create a `.ipynb` notebook in JupyterLab.

4. **Install Required Packages:**  
   Use `pip` or `conda` to install necessary libraries.

5. **Load Data:**  
   Load the dataset as a pandas DataFrame:
   ```
   df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Chabri Ganesh\Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.csv")
   print("📊 Data Preview:")
   print(df.head())
   print("\n📈 Summary Stats:")
   print(df.describe())

6. **Visualizations:**  
- **Average Screen Time by Age:**  
  Bar graph with color-coded age groups.  
  *Hue = age_group_mean.index (e.g., 8-10, 11-13)*

- **Screen Time Distribution by Gender:**  
  Boxplot colored by gender categories.

## 🚀 Web Application

- Create a folder `Screen-Time-app`.
- Add `app.py` to build the Streamlit web application.
- Implement data loading, filters (age, gender, locality), and graphs similar to notebook visualizations.
- Run the app locally using:
  ```
  streamlit run app.py
- Deploy on **Streamlit Cloud** for public access.

---

## 📚 Creating Repository & Deployment

- Use **GitHub Desktop** or CLI to add all project files to a GitHub repo.
- Push your changes to GitHub.
- In **Streamlit Cloud Community**:  
- Select "Create App"  
- Link your GitHub repository and specify the app file (`app.py`)
- Deploy the app live for public use.
